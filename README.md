# Peoject Description:

- A Simple Number Guessing Game in Python. A Fun and Interactive Python Game
- This project creates a simple number guessing game in Python, where the user has to guess a randomly generated number.
- The game is designed to practice fundamental Python concepts like random number generation, user input, and conditional logic.
- The project aims to provide a fun and interactive way to learn Python programming skills.

# This Project involves the following steps:

 Step 1: Random Number Generation:
         Generate a random number using Python's random module.
         Define the range of the random number, e.g., between 1 and 100.

Step 2: User Input: Use Python's input function to get a number input from the user.
          Prompt the user to enter a number within the defined range.

Step 3: Number Comparison:
          Compare the user's input number with the generated random number.
          If the user's number matches the random number, congratulate the user.

Step 4: Hint Generation:
         If the user's number does not match the random number, provide a hint.
         The hint can be, for example, "Your number is too high" or "Your number is too low."

Step 5: Repeat Gameplay:
         Ask the user if they want to play again.
          If the user responds affirmatively, restart the game.

Step 6: Game Over:
          When the user chooses to stop playing, end the game and thank the user.

 # Conclusion:


   The Number Guessing Game project has been a successful implementation of a simple yet engaging game using Python.
   Through this project, we have demonstrated the use of basic programming concepts such as variables, data types, loops, and conditional statements.
   The game has been designed to generate a random number within a specified range, and the player has to guess the number within a limited number of attempts. 
   The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether the guess is higher or lower than the actual number.
